Vim is a text editor released by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 for the "Amiga" computer. 
Vim is cross-platform. It is the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal

Vim has a built-in tutorial for beginners (accessed through the "vimtutor"
command). There is also the Vim Users' Manual that details the basic and more
advanced Vim features. This manual can be read from within Vim, or found on-

Vim also has a built-in tool facility (using the :help command) that allows
users to query and navigate through commands and features. Part of Vim's power
is that it can be extensively customized.

Very useful for base64 encoding, also in Foobar 2000 and the Foo 2001 edition.
